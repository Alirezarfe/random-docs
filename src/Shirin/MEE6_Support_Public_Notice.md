# MEE6 Support Public Notice

- **Some commands (despite their public nature) are limited to server moderators**, Those are `userinfo`, `roleinfo`, `serverinfo` and `avatar`, You may use these commands in [one of the associated emoji servers](https://discord.com/channels/159962941502783488/623830479589736478). Reasoning behind this is to respect how the bot itself that the discord server is based on configured, If you can't use a command in MEE6; You won't be able to use a command in Shirin that serves the similar or same purpose either
- **Some commands have no place in any of the MEE6 associated servers**, Which is currently `gtaline` (mostly due profanity usage);
- [`#commands-and-offtopic`](https://discord.com/channels/159962941502783488/280870279746420736) is considered a *command only* channel, Meaning that unless you're a server moderator **you're limited to using commands in the said channel**
- `suggestion` command is a command special to the MEE6 Support Server that looks up suggestions from the [`#upvote-suggestions`](https://discord.com/channels/159962941502783488/534041825694973952) channel, It provides a rather reliable method than discord's search function (for example there are about 240+ upvotable suggestions right now and if you search via the `in:#upvote-suggestions` option you'll see that discord has indexed messages of way below the said amount)
- `checkpremium` is a command that allows Premium users to claim their Premium role on demand if MEE6 didn't already issue it to them for some reason or e.g user lost their Premium role due shard desynchronization or performed a [transfer](http://mee6.xyz/premium-transfer) (which is by the way, a known issue);
