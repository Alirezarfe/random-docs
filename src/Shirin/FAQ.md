# FAQ

### What is even FAQ?
→ **F**requently **A**sked **Q**uestions.

### Is above question really frequent?
→ Surprisingly no, I'm not sure why it is even a FAQ. But afterall it's 21st century so why the hell not.

### Despite Shirin being a private bot, Can I use her as well?
→ Depending on server's configuration, yes. In some servers she may be limited to server moderators. Otherwise there will always be commands that are available for public usage, See [usage section](Usage.md) to learn more.

### Can I invite her to my servers?
→ I appreciate your interest but no, Shirin is a private bot and she will forever be that way.

### Shirin doesn't respond to certain commands of mine but does for an another user's so what gives?
→ You most likely don't have the permission to use the commands, If you are not allowed to use a command Shirin will ignore you and move on quietly. You also can't see the help for commands you are not allowed to use.

She also ignores commands that are invoked outside *command only channels* unless they are by a server moderator.

### What is the origin of Shirin's avatar?
→ https://disney.fandom.com/wiki/Nita

### Is the bot open source?
→ No, call me greedy but I would rather keep it that way and this is not subject to change.

### Who the hell are you?
→ Well, First off watch your tone you lousy FAQ, I practically wrote you. I'm just a dude in his 20s whose further real life details are irrelevant in this documentation.

### You said "First off" in the answer for the previous FAQ and now I got stuck in it expecting a "Second off" and it just never arrives, Please help what do I do?
→ You're on your own, sorry.

### Why is the bot not so user friendly?
→ Reminder that Shirin is a private bot and she was never really intended to be a public service so user friendliness isn't really focused on unless in special circumstances.

### What happened to the public todo and changelog?
→ Both have been deprecated from this documentation, public changelogs will be announced in the discord server from now on, if you would like to stay in touch feel free to use the discord server invite in [Epilogue](../Epilogue.md) and opt in to `@shirin updates` in the `#role-room` channel. The public todo was moved to a [trello board](<https://trello.com/b/rceq47WA/shirin-bot>).
