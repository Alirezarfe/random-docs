# Usage

Following notation represents a basic command:

`<prefix><command>`
> ⚠️ `<>`/`[]` indicate placeholders so do not interpret them literally

Like most discord bots, Each command comes after a prefix. Although do note that servers may have command prefixes of their own, in which case `help` command (more on that soon) will make that clear, However bot's mention as command prefix is always guaranteed to exist.
