# Misconduct

Abusing or senselessly spamming commands may result in being temporarily or permanently banned from using commands depending on severity.

Do not disturb users by pinging them after commands that take user arguments and [resort to using IDs instead](https://dis.gd/findmyid), Same applies to mentioning mentionable roles possessed by server members.
