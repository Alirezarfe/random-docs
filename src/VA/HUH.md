Samurai Jack, Aku, INTRO
> Long ago in a distant land, I, aku, the shape-shifting master of darkness, unleashed an unspeakable evil! but a foolish samurai warrior wielding a magic sword stepped forth to oppose me. before the final blow was struck, I tore open a portal in time and flung him into the future, where my evil is law! now the fool seeks to return to the past, and undo the future that is aku!

Taken, Bryan Mills, PHONE CALL
> I don't know who you are. I don't know what you want. If you are looking for ransom I can tell you I don't have money, but what I do have are a very particular set of skills. Skills I have acquired over a very long career. Skills that make me a nightmare for people like you. If you let my daughter go now that'll be the end of it. I will not look for you, I will not pursue you, but if you don't, I will look for you, I will find you and I will kill you.
